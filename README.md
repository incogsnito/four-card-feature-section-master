<h2>Feautres</h2>
<p>This is a website coded using HTML and CSS.</p>
<p>It features a simple four card layout with a header.</p>
<p>They should be perfectly responsive up until about a screen size of 300-330px</p>

<h2>Process</h2>
<p>This challenge was rather easy when starting out until I ran into a lot of bugs</p>
<p>I took multiple breaks and asked others for help.</p>
<p>At the end of my first attempt, I had learned a lot, but still not enough to finish the project</p>

<h2>Plateau</h2>
<p>My learning would stagnate and I would run into multiple bugs that I was unable to fix.</p>
<p>Asking around didn't help anymore until I was told to learn about grid.</p>

<h2>Attempt 2</h2>
<p>After finishing a course on grid, I would then proceed to work on this layout for the second time.</p>
<p>It definitely turned out a lot better than the first attempt, but there was still a lot of room for improvement</p>
<p>I still don't understand how to place things and how writing different rules will affect positioning. So I still write a lot of cluttered CSS that gets in the way.</p>

<h2>End</h2>
<p>I finished this project after a week+. The goal was to get it done in under two days. but that was blown out the window. I'm taking a serious step back from this stuff. I will now be pursuing more personal projects to further improve.</p>
<p> I won't be doing frontend mentor challenges for a while or as frequently. I want to learn a lot more and come back way better. So I can move up from beginner to intermediate.</p>
<p>Thanks for checking out the repository!</p>
